## Moving Back
The last couple posts were post graduation work I completed. But, this project was completed during the first half of the semester for COMP 490 - Senior Design and Development it was a solo project. It taught me a lot about software development and being able to use an API in conjunction with Python code and sqlite database.

### Objective
The project goal was simple, give the university's [Collaborative University Business Experiences](https://www.bridgew.edu/academics/cubes) a working piece of software that allows professors to pick projects created by students to sponsor them. 

The project was divided into 4 sprints, each with their own specific deliverables needed.

However, executing this project properly became much more tedious than imagined.

#### Scope
Since this is a Software Development project all coding principals were followed. Hence [slack](https://slack.com/) was used for communication, [jira](https://jira.com/) was used for task tracking. Furthermore tests were needed on the deliverables for each sprint and the project was to be presented to 'stakeholders'.

This makes for a real world level project at a capstone course for a Computer Science degreee!

#### Tools Used
<ul>
<li>Python 3.8</li>
<li>Wufoo Forms</li>
<li>SQLite </li>
<li>GitHub CI/CD (Actions)</li>
</ul>

## Sprint 1
The goal of the first sprint was to setup a [Wufoo Forms](https://www.wufoo.com/) account to store entries for project ideas from students. 

Then grab those entries from the Wufoo website via their API and return a valid JSON response.
#### Code to retrieve responses
This code uses the `requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth` package to send an HTTP request with my API key `wufoo_key` and basic password `pass` since no authentication was enabled. 

If the response code is not 200 indicating a succesful response then the error will be handled gracefully.
```Python
def get_wufoo_data() -> dict:
    response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(wufoo_key, 'pass'))
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Failed to get data, response code:{response.status_code} and error message: {response.reason} ")
        sys.exit(-1)
    jsonresponse = response.json()
    return jsonresponse
```

With some more code to save the responses in a text file made the Sprint complete.

## Sprint 2 
The objective of Sprint 2 was not to store the entries in a text file but rather in a SQLite database. SQLite was chosen since it is lightweight and can easily run in the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

First I created a Function to setup a database for my entries when needed.
```SQL
 cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS entries(
EntryId INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL, first_name TEXT NOT NULL, last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
job_title TEXT NOT NULL, org_name TEXT NOT NULL, phone_num INTEGER NOT NULL,
school_id INTEGER NOT NULL, org_site TEXT, course TEXT, speaker TEXT, siteVisit TEXT,
job_shadow TEXT,
carreer_panel TEXT, summer_2022 TEXT, fall_2022 TEXT, spring_2023 TEXT, summer_2023 TEXT, other TEXT,
permission TEXT, date_created TEXT,
created_by TEXT, date_update TEXT, updated_by TEXT);''')
```

More methods were created to access and close the database connection as well.
```Python
def open_db(filename: str) -> Tuple[sqlite3.Connection, sqlite3.Cursor]:
    db_connection = sqlite3.connect(filename)
    cursor = db_connection.cursor()
    return db_connection, cursor

def close_db(connection: sqlite3.Connection):
    connection.commit()
    connection.close()
```

Then this code I call my previously made function `get_wufoo_data()` to grab the JSON responses, store it in an array `data` and then insert that in a database named `demo_db`. Finally the database will be closed to follow proper guidelines.
```Python
def main():
    data = get_wufoo_data()
    data1 = data['Entries']
    conn, cursor = open_db("demo_db.sqlite")
    print(type(conn))
    setup_db(cursor)
    insert_db(cursor, data1)
    close_db(conn)
```

Consequently a test was made to ensure these functions behaved proerly.
```Python
def test_db():
    conn, cursor = open_db("test_db.sqlite")
    print(type(conn))
    response = get_wufoo_data()
    data1 = response['Entries']
    setup_db(cursor)
    insert_db(cursor, data1)
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM entries LIMIT 1")
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    assert result is not None, "No entry found in the first row of the table"
    close_db(conn)
```

## Sprint 3
