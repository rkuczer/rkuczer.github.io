### Objective
The purpose of this website is to document all of my learning progress in the world of Computer Science. It is to better track my learning in various domains such as security, system administration, cloud, coding, and much more!

### How I made this Site
There is no better first post to document other than how I made this site in the first place. So that anyone else wondering how they can start can get moving right away. The main tool being used is the Static Site Generator named **Jekyll**.
#### Steps
<ol>
  <li>Have Ruby, Git, Bundle, and Jekyll installed to the latest versions.</li>
  <li>Fork a repository that has a jekyll compatable theme that appeals to you. I chose chirpy since it supports light/dark mode and has a good aesthetic.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository locally and alter the config.yml file to your corresponding timezone, title, tagline, description, url to point to (this is GITHUBUSERNAME.github.io).</li>
  <li>Use bundle to download the needed dependencies.</li>
  <li>Use the command 
  `bundle exec jekyll serve` to test the site locally.</li>
  <li> Use Jekyll to create your first post like I am now here. Do this by adding a markdown file into your posts sub-directory then put in the necessary front matter. Front matter being the header on every post in jekyll which looks like `---
title: My new portfolio
date: 2024-02-12 12:00:00 
categories: [introduction, post]
tags: [hello,welcome]
---`</li>
  <li>Lastly, push the new code to your repository. This is when the site itself will be built and the code will be analyzed with ubuntu then added to pages via GitHub Actions<li>
</ol>

This is a very easy way to get a nice looking portfolio/blog site up and running in an hour or less. I plan to advance this site by:
- [ ] Customizing the favicon: Adjuset the small 25*25 image in each tab on a web browser to something more personalized.
- [ ] Alter and customize the CSS for the site to my liking so it is just not black/white.

That's it! Hope you enjoyed my first post there are many more to come.
