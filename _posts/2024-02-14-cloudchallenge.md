# Cloud Resume Challenge
### Objective
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple-step resume project which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career as a Cloud Engineer. The project was first published by Forrest Brazeal. who works at Cloud Guru, a cloud education company.

### Taking The Challenge
My process in expanding my skill set to the cloud and specifically **Azure** has been a long and rewarding experience. Learning new skills and concepts, gaining hands-on experience through interactive training and labs, as well as obtaining my Azure certification (first of many).

However, when preparing to apply for positions building my portfolio with projects became a focus. Learning the  skills was only half the battle, but being able to convey the skills learned through a project that has some real world application is where I believe the majority of the value came in as a interviewee. b
