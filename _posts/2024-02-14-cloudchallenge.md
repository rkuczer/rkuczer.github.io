# Cloud Resume Challenge
### Objective
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple-step resume project which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career as a Cloud Engineer. The project was first published by Forrest Brazeal. who works at Cloud Guru, a cloud education company.

### Taking The Challenge
My process in expanding my skill set to the cloud and specifically **Azure** has been a long and rewarding experience. Learning new skills and concepts, gaining hands-on experience through interactive training and labs, as well as obtaining my Azure certification (first of many).

However, when preparing to apply for positions building my portfolio with projects became a focus. Learning the  skills was only half the battle, but being able to convey the skills learned through a project that has some real world application is where I believe the majority of the value came in as a interviewee. b

#### Steps
<ol>
    <li>Certification: AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) is an introductory certification that orients someone with Azure. It offers a great lay of the land of the possibilities with the Cloud Platform. This is the first step I took. </li>
    <li>HTML: Secondly my resume was currently in a word doc, instead of converting it to HTML manually I used a tool like <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/">here</a>. So it will be able to appear nicely in a webpage.</li>
    <li>CSS: I created a CSS file for my resume's style
    <div class="image-container">
            <img src="css.jpg" alt="CSS Image" class="float-right" />
        </div>
