# Where security meets transparency.
In the realm of digital security, the concept of integrity holds significant weight. Ensuring the integrity of shared files is paramount to maintaining trust and reliability. The CIA Triad, which emphasizes Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, underscores the importance of safeguarding data against unauthorized modifications. 

This is where my file integrity monitor comes into play. Its primary purpose is to meticulously scan and verify the integrity of files, ensuring that they remain unchanged and authentic. By upholding the integrity of these files, users can trust that the information they access is accurate and reliable. 

## The Goal
When people mention data it is usually in three forms:
<ul>
<li>Data At-Rest</li>
<li>Data In-Transit </li>
<li>Data In-Use </li>
</ul>

My file integriy monitor specifically applies to data in-transit, since this is the point at which attackers would attempt to intercept the traffic and change contents of a file. Furthermore, since **SSL and TLS** is used to already to encrypt traffic and protect it's **confidentiality**. My File Integrity Monitor serves as insurance, this is from the fact that as a file travels across different networks you have no idea if it will be intercepted. So the monitor serves as a final check that nothing has been changed. 

## How it Works

_File Integrity Monitor Structure_

The first step is address what the user is aiming at accomplishing. They can either create a new baseline for a file which will calculate the hash of the target file(s) and store it in a text file. 

Or, users can monitor a file that they already have a baseline. This will be done by loading the file hashes from the text file where it was saved previosuly in the baseline section. Then, the Powershell script will run continuously and loop through the target file hash(es), compare the result with the baseline and notify the user if anything has changed.

The language used for this script is powershell, it is the most versatile and has an awesome range of uses.

## Show Me the Code
```Powershell
Function Calculate-File-Hash($filepath) {
    $filehash = Get-FileHash -Path $filepath -Algorithm SHA256
    return $filehash
}
```
The first function calculates the hash of the file with the `$filepath` parameter as the path, the SHA256 algorithm will be used. If this was more advanced a stronger algorithm would be used with salting the hash. 

```Powershell
Function Erase-Baseline-If-Already-Exists() {
    $baselineExists = Test-Path -Path .\baseline.txt

    if ($baselineExists) {
        # Delete it
        Remove-Item -Path .\baseline.txt
    }
}
```
Next is more so a utility function that will delete a file as a baseline if it already exists. You cant monitor what you are not measuring.
```Powershell
if ($response -eq "A".ToUpper()) {
    # Delete baseline.txt if it already exists
    Erase-Baseline-If-Already-Exists

    # Calculate Hash from the target files and store in baseline.txt
    # Collect all files in the target folder
    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path .\Files

    # For each file, calculate the hash, and write to baseline.txt
    foreach ($f in $files) {
        $hash = Calculate-File-Hash $f.FullName
        "$($hash.Path)|$($hash.Hash)" | Out-File -FilePath .\baseline.txt -Append
    }
    
}
```
Moving on, the code above is executed if the user answers the letter a or A because of the `.ToUpper()` function. Here a hash will be calculated of all the files in the "./Files" directory and will be reported to the baseline text file. 

Creating the baseline was more difficult than monitoring it...

```Powershell
elseif ($response -eq "B".ToUpper()) {
    
    $fileHashDictionary = @{}

    # Load file|hash from baseline.txt and store them in a dictionary
    $filePathsAndHashes = Get-Content -Path .\baseline.txt
    
    foreach ($f in $filePathsAndHashes) {
         $fileHashDictionary.add($f.Split("|")[0],$f.Split("|")[1])
    }
```
To start off, this code will create a dictionary for the file hashes and read in the content of the baseline via the `Get-Content` function. The foreach block will split each line of the baseline into key/value pair being `[FilePath]|[Hash]`. 
```Powershell
while ($true) {
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
        
        $files = Get-ChildItem -Path .\Files

        # For each file, calculate the hash, and write to baseline.txt
        foreach ($f in $files) {
            $hash = Calculate-File-Hash $f.FullName
            #"$($hash.Path)|$($hash.Hash)" | Out-File -FilePath .\baseline.txt -Append

            # Notify if a new file has been created
            if ($fileHashDictionary[$hash.Path] -eq $null) {
                # A new file has been created!
                Write-Host "$($hash.Path) has been created!" -ForegroundColor Green
            }
            else {

                # Notify if a new file has been changed
                if ($fileHashDictionary[$hash.Path] -eq $hash.Hash) {
                    # The file has not changed
                }
                else {
                    # File file has been compromised!, notify the user
                    Write-Host "$($hash.Path) has changed!!!" -ForegroundColor Yellow
                }
            }
        }
```
Almost there... This next code part of the previous function will continuously monitor the file with the saved baseline. If a file has been changed or created the user will be notified and the color of the powershell editor will change.

_Output if a Change is Noticed_

## All in All
In conclusion, implementing a robust file integrity monitoring (FIM) system is paramount in fortifying cybersecurity defenses and upholding the integrity aspect of the CIA triad. The FIM serves as a critical safeguard against unauthorized modifications or tampering of crucial files and data within an organization's network. 

By continuously monitoring and verifying the integrity of files, organizations can detect and respond swiftly to potential security breaches or malicious activities, thus preserving the trustworthiness and reliability of their data. Moreover, FIM contributes significantly to maintaining compliance with regulatory standards and industry best practices, ensuring data integrity remains a cornerstone of cybersecurity strategies. As cyber threats continue to evolve, investing in a FIM not only enhances security posture but also reinforces the resilience of organizational infrastructures against emerging threats, ultimately safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.
