steps to setup ssh on a non-standard port with key auth

Here’s a complete, secure step-by-step guide to set up SSH on a non-standard port (e.g., 2222) with public-key authentication only (password login disabled).

1. Choose a non-standard port
Pick a high port (>1024, preferably >10000 to avoid conflicts).
Example: 2222

2. Edit the SSH server configuration
On the server (usually /etc/ssh/sshd_config):

Bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Make these changes (uncomment or add if missing):

conf
# Change the port (you can keep 22 active too if you want, or remove it)
Port 2222

# Disable password authentication (forces key-only)
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Optional but recommended
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password   # or "no" if you never want root login
AllowUsers yourusername             # restrict to specific users (optional)

# Optional: stricter settings
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
UsePAM yes                          # usually keep yes
Save and exit.

3. Restart the SSH service
Bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/AlmaLinux/Fedora
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# Check if it started correctly
sudo systemctl status sshd
4. Update firewall rules
Allow the new port and (optionally) block the old one.

UFW (Ubuntu):

Bash
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
sudo ufw deny 22/tcp          # optional: block old port
sudo ufw reload
Firewalld (RHEL-based):

Bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2222/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=ssh   # removes port 22
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
iptables (if you use it directly):

Bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT   # optional
5. Generate an SSH key pair on your client (if you don’t have one)
Bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
# or for older systems:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
Press Enter to accept default location (~/.ssh/id_ed25519 or id_rsa).

6. Copy the public key to the server
Easiest way (still using password temporarily):

Bash
ssh-copy-id -p 2222 youruser@your-server-ip
If you’ve already disabled password auth, manually copy:

Bash
# On client
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy the output, then on the server:
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Paste the key, save, then:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
7. Test the new connection
From your client:

Bash
ssh -p 2222 youruser@your-server-ip
It should log you in without asking for a password.

8. (Optional) Update your SSH client config for convenience
On your client, edit ~/.ssh/config:

conf
Host myserver
    HostName your-server-ip-or-domain
    Port 2222
    User yourusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Now you can just type:

Bash
ssh myserver
9. (Recommended) Install fail2ban or similar
Even on a non-standard port, bots will eventually scan for it.
Install fail2ban to ban brute-force attempts:

Bash
sudo apt install fail2ban    # Debian/Ubuntu
# or
sudo dnf install fail2ban    # RHEL-based
It works out of the box with SSH on any port.

Done! You now have SSH running on a non-standard port with key-only authentication — significantly more secure than the default setup.

how to only allow a port (2222 ssh) on the local network and not the external network

Determine Your Local Network Subnet
Before configuring the firewall, identify your local (LAN) subnet. This is typically something like 192.168.1.0/24 or 10.0.0.0/8. Run this on the server:

Bash
ip route show default | awk '/default/ {print $3}' | xargs ip route show | awk '{print $1}' | head -1
Or simply:

Bash
ip addr show | grep inet | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1
Use the relevant CIDR (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). Replace <local_subnet> in the steps below with this value.

Option 1: Using UFW (Ubuntu/Debian)
UFW is simple and allows source-based rules.

Ensure UFW is enabled and SSH is allowed internally:
Bash
sudo ufw enable  # If not already enabled
sudo ufw allow from <local_subnet> to any port 2222 proto tcp
(Optional but recommended) Deny external access explicitly:
Bash
sudo ufw deny 2222/tcp  # This blocks everything else on 2222
Reload and verify:
Bash
sudo ufw reload
sudo ufw status verbose  # Should show your allow rule
Test:
From a local machine: ssh -p 2222 user@server-ip (should work).
From external (e.g., mobile hotspot): Should fail to connect.
Option 2: Using Firewalld (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/Rocky/AlmaLinux)
Firewalld uses zones (e.g., "internal" for LAN, "public" for external). Assign your interface to the internal zone.

Identify your LAN interface:
Bash
ip link show  # Usually eth0, enp0s3, etc. Note the name (e.g., enp1s0).
Assign the interface to the internal zone:
Bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --change-interface=<interface_name>
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Add SSH to the internal zone only:
Bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-port=2222/tcp
# Or if you want to use the SSH service but custom port: --add-service=ssh but edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config first if needed
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Ensure external (public) zone blocks it:
By default, public zone doesn't allow 2222, but confirm:
Bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all  # Should not include 2222
Test: Same as above—local works, external doesn't.
Option 3: Using iptables (Direct or Legacy Systems)
For raw iptables (if not using UFW/firewalld):

Add a rule to allow only from local subnet:
Bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -s <local_subnet> -j ACCEPT
Drop everything else on 2222:
Bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -j DROP
Save the rules:
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install iptables-persistent then sudo netfilter-persistent save.
RHEL-based: sudo service iptables save (or use iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables).
Test: As above.
Additional Tips
If using a router: Ensure your router's firewall also blocks port 2222 externally (port forwarding off for 2222). This server-side config assumes direct exposure, but local-only means no external forwarding.
Cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure): Use security groups/network ACLs instead:
AWS: Add inbound rule for TCP 2222 from your VPC CIDR (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
GCP: Firewall rule allowing 2222 from your subnet.
Azure: NSG rule for port 2222 source <local_subnet>.
Verify externally: Use an online port scanner (e.g., from a VPS) like nmap -p 2222 your-public-ip—it should show closed/filtered.
Revert if locked out: Have console access (e.g., via provider dashboard) ready.
This setup ensures SSH on 2222 is LAN-only, enhancing security by preventing internet exposure. If your distro/firewall differs, provide details for tailored steps!

/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT convert to ufw

iptables to UFW Conversion
The provided iptables rule:

text
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
allows new incoming TCP connections on port 25565 (commonly used for Minecraft servers) while leveraging connection tracking for stateful inspection.

Equivalent UFW Command
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly wrapper around iptables and handles stateful rules (including NEW, ESTABLISHED, and RELATED states) automatically via its default policies. No need for explicit -m state matching.

Run this on your Ubuntu/Debian system:

Bash
sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp
This adds a rule to allow TCP traffic on port 25565 from any source.
UFW will translate it to an equivalent iptables chain (e.g., in the ufw-user-input chain) with conntrack support.
Verification
Reload UFW: sudo ufw reload
Check status: sudo ufw status verbose
(You should see something like: 25565/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere)
Notes
If UFW is not enabled yet:sudo ufw enable (but test rules first to avoid lockout).
Restrict to specific source (e.g., local subnet):sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 25565 proto tcp
Delete if needed:sudo ufw delete allow 25565/tcp
This assumes IPv4; for IPv6, add /v6 suffix (e.g., ufw allow 25565/tcp applies to both by default if IPv6 is enabled).
This keeps the same security posture but simplifies management! If you have a full ruleset or specific constraints, share more details.

# Objective

After diving into different subjects in the realm of computers, networking, system administration and security you get exposed to a lot all at once. To be able to retain the information effectively without statically studying all day it seems the best way to learn is to split your time studying & building. Furthermore, it is even better if you can build something you yourself can use but if other people in your life can it's even better. 

Hence my new addition to the portfolio of projects is configuring a Modded Minecraft server for me and my friends to play on. This covers everything from adjusting the BIOS of a Dell tower, installing Ubuntu, hardening Linux OS and the network to only allow clients what they need. To sum it up its IT, 'sys administration', and security all in one!

## Hardware
Thankfully I had a spare Dell Optiplex 7010 tower lying around, this was perfect as it was not too beefy but also not a peashooter. For reference it was new when Windows 7 came out.

#### Specifications
* 320 GB STA
* Intel Core i7-3770S
* 8 Gb RAM (DDR3)

## Step 1: Changing the OS
I wanted the max amount of resources available for the Minecraft server since I was on limited hardware so I chose **Ubuntu**.  I chose my favorite USB stick then used Rufus to format it and put the latest Ubuntu ISO on it. I then put it into the Optiplex while it was off, turned it on, spammed **F12** to get it into the BIOS and finally set the boot order to be the USB first. 

I then installed Ubuntu and followed the prompts without changing anything. 

## Step 2: Linux Hygiene
The next step was to have Linux properly setup prior to adding everything for minecraft, this included using the following commands while directly connected to the Linux box. *The commands assume you have sudo access, security setup will be in the next section*. 
1. `apt update && apt upgrade`: Update & Upgrades
2. `apt install curl/wget`: Install necessary packages 
3. `apt install screen`: Used to have the server run properly when not logged onto the server.
4. `/opt, mkdir minecraft, cd minecraft`: Navigate to the `/opt` directory then create a called minecraft then navigate to it. Once in the minecraft directory, download the forge installer for 1.12.2 and then copy it to this dir. This versionn of forge is included as it is not extremely hold but has the most compatability with everyone's favorite mods.
5. `java -jar forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860-installer.jar --installServer`: Run the forge installer, creates a second file called **forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar**.
6. `java -Xms1024M -Xmx2000M -jar /opt/minecraft/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar nogui`: Start the minecraft server with a minimum 1gb of memory with a maximum of 2gb allocated, also run the server in nogui for faster performace. Knowing how xms, xms, jvm works in conjunction with [managing JVM's heaps](https://sematext.com/glossary/jvm-heap/) is useful here.
7. Accept the eula by navigating to the `eula.txt` file with `nano` then set `eula=true`.
8. *Optional:* `nano` to the `server.properties` file then set the `level-seed` to a preset seed if that is desired.
9. Create a script to start the minecraft server if that is desired, I did it. It should be a `.sh` file with the following contents. After creating it make sure to use `chmod` to make it executable.
```bash
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#!/bin/bash
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd /opt/minecraft/ && java -Xms1024M -Xmx2000M -jar /opt/minecraft/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar nogui
Before starting the server use the screen command followed by ctrl + a, cto start a screen session. Then start the server with the script, after that is complete use the shortcut ctrl + a, d to detach from the session allowing you to do other configuration while the server is running. To reattach to the screen session whenever you need use the screen -r command, learn more on the screen command here.
At this point users on your local network can connect to the server and play on it as long as they are also running Minecraft + Forge 1.12.2. However there are no mods currently and we need to make the server available over the internet (securely) still.

## Step 3. Mods

Download your mods from one of the reputable mod library sites that are supported with Forge, I used **CurseForge**. Users on the client side will put their mods in this folder:C:\Users\YOURUSERHERE\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods

## Step 4. Security

Now that the server is running with everything installed on the Minecraft side, now is time to harden the server. Each section below will go over the specific security addition.

### SSH Security

The following section applies changes to SSH configuration, choosing a **non-standard port** and only allowing **key based authentication**.

I chose a non-standard ssh port other than the default of 22 to avoid low hanging fruit style attacks were the port will scanned either manually or automatically to identify potential system vulnerabilites.
Key based authentication was used to provide stronger authentication and remove possible worries of using a password and having it be leaked.
To do this navigate to the SSH server config file at /etc/ssh/sshd_config, then make the following changes to the file.

conf
# Change the port (you can keep 22 active too if you want, or remove it)
Port 2222

# Disable password authentication (forces key-only)
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Optional but recommended
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password   # or "no" if you never want root login
AllowUsers yourusername             # restrict to specific users (optional)
After this restart the SSH service with sudo systemctl restart and generate a ssh key pair with the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com" I then transferred the key to my other local machine. Test connection status with the command ssh -p 2222 youruser@your-server-ip.

### Network Security

I first setup port forwarding on my router to allow users to access my internal server from my public IP on port 25565. Reference your routers documentation to complete this.
I then blocked all other non-necessary ports on the server itself with the command:
sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp.
To only allow SSH locally only ensure ufw is enabled then use the command: sudo ufw allow from <local_subnet> to any port 2222 proto tcp. In my case the local subnet was 192.168....
### Whitelisting

Since my server was visible on port 25565 I then use whitelisting to only allow certain player's to be able to join. To do this first set white-list=true in the server.properties file. Then restart the server, then use the command whitelist add USERNAME for each player you want to be able to join.

are there any spelling errors here

Spelling and Typo Corrections
I've reviewed the entire markdown document for spelling errors (misspellings of words), grammatical typos that affect spelling (e.g., missing letters), and minor formatting issues that could be seen as "errors" in a technical write-up (e.g., inconsistent capitalization or spacing in code/commands). I focused on the content text, excluding code blocks unless they contain plain English words.

The document is well-written overall, with mostly correct technical terminology. However, there are 12 notable issues—mostly minor misspellings, typos, or inconsistencies. I've categorized them below for clarity, with the original text, correction, and location. I didn't include pure grammar/style suggestions (e.g., "set up" vs. "setup" as a verb/noun) unless they involve spelling.

1. Misspellings/Typos in Main Body Text
Location	Original	Correction	Reason
Objective section, 2nd sentence	"without statically studying all day"	"without staying to study all day" (or similar; "statically" seems like a misspelling of "staying")	"Statically" is spelled correctly but doesn't fit context (implying "immobile" studying); likely a typo for "staying".
Objective section, last sentence	"its IT"	"it's IT"	Missing apostrophe for contraction "it is".
Hardware section	"Dell Optiplex" (appears twice: main para and Step 1)	"Dell OptiPlex"	Brand name capitalization: "P" is capitalized.
Hardware > Specifications	"320 GB STA"	"320 GB SATA"	Acronym error: "STA" should be "SATA" (Serial ATA).
Step 2, item 4	"This versionn of forge"	"This version of Forge"	Double "n"; also capitalize "Forge" for consistency as a proper noun.
Step 2, item 4	"not extremely hold"	"not extremely old"	Typo: "hold" → "old".
Step 2, item 4	"compatability"	"compatibility"	Missing one "i".
Step 2, item 6	"performace"	"performance"	Missing "n".
Step 2, item 10	"ctrl + a, c`to"	"Ctrl + A, then C to"	Missing space after backtick; standardize capitalization (Ctrl/A common in docs).
Step 3	"folder:`C:\Users..."	"folder: `C:\Users..."	Missing space after colon.
SSH Security subsection	"were the port will scanned"	"where the port will be scanned"	"Were" → "where" (contextual misspelling/homophone); add "be" for grammar, but spelling-focused.
SSH Security subsection	"system vulnerabilites"	"system vulnerabilities"	Missing "i" and extra "e".
2. Issues in Code/Commands (Spelling or Formatting)
These are minor but could confuse readers:

Step 2, item 6 command description: "xms, xms, jvm" → "Xms, Xmx, JVM" (typo: second "xms" should be "Xmx"; capitalize JVM).
Step 2, item 9 script: Indentation is inconsistent (leading spaces in bash block)—not a spelling error, but bash blocks in Markdown should use 4-space indents for proper rendering.
Network Security: "sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp" – This is factually a allow command, but text says "blocked all other non-necessary ports". Not spelling, but a semantic error (UFW denies by default, so this enables only 25565).
Summary
Total spelling misspellings: 8 (e.g., versionn, hold, compatability).
Brand/technical acronyms: 3 (OptiPlex, SATA).
No major issues in code blocks themselves (e.g., commands are syntactically correct).
The post is dated October 13, 2025, but current date is November 25, 2025—no impact on spelling.
If you meant to include grammar, factual accuracy, or style fixes (e.g., "peashooter" is fun but informal), let me know for a deeper edit. Otherwise, apply these, and it'll be polished!

Creating this Minecraft server not only served as a platform for fun with me and my friends but also reinforced my learning within the system administration world. Although the server itself was on a small scale the knowledge learned can be applied at scale, everything from Linux, security, administration. improve this closer

Building this Minecraft server wasn't just a gateway to endless adventures with my friends—it was a hands-on masterclass in system administration. Sure, it ran on modest hardware, but the principles I honed along the way scale effortlessly: from mastering Linux basics and fortifying security to streamlining day-to-day ops. It's proof that the best lessons come from projects that blend passion with purpose, and I'm already eyeing the next build.

3.6s
get rid of the fancy wording

Setting up this Minecraft server gave me and my friends a fun way to play together, while also helping me learn more about system administration. The hardware was basic, but the skills I picked up—like handling Linux, adding security, and managing the setup—can work for bigger projects too.

2.9s
slightly more fancy wording

Constructing this Minecraft server turned a simple evening of gaming with friends into a rewarding dive into system administration. Though built on humble hardware, the foundational skills I gained—from Linux fundamentals and robust security measures to efficient server management—readily scale to enterprise-level challenges. It's a reminder that the most enduring knowledge emerges from hands-on projects that marry enjoyment with expertise.

2.5s
can you create images

Yes, I can generate images using AI tools like Flux. What kind of image did you have in mind? Describe it in detail (e.g., style, subject, colors, composition), and I'll confirm before creating one.

This covers everything from adjusting the BIOS of a Dell tower, installing Ubuntu, hardening the Linux OS and my network itself to only allow users with what they need. To sum it up its IT, 'sys administration', and security all in one!

*This article assumes you have sudo access on the server and are knowledgeable with Minecraft & Linux*

## Hardware
Thankfully I had a spare Dell OptiPlex 7010 tower lying around, this was perfect as it was not too beefy but also not a peashooter. For reference it was new when Windows 7 came out. I wanted to self-host this server as it provided:
* Max control
* Ability to work with the CLI
* Cheaper than a VPS
* Learning the process start to finish of hosting

### Server Specifications
* 320 GB SATA
* Intel Core i7-3770S
* 8 Gb RAM (DDR3)

## Step 1: Changing the OS
I wanted the max amount of resources available for the Minecraft server since I was on limited hardware so I chose **Ubuntu**. This was from the fact that Windows inherently has more 'bloat' that can eat away at the total amount of compute power for other processes that matter more. 

So, I chose my favorite USB stick then used [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) to format it and put the latest Ubuntu ISO file on it. I then put it into the OptiPlex while it was off, turned it on, spammed **F12** to get it into the BIOS and set the boot order to be the USB first.

This version of Forge is included as it is not extremely hold but has the most compatability with everyone's favorite mods. *Note: If using SSH for initial configuration use something like WinSCP or SCP to transfer the files to your Linux server*.
5. `java -jar forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860-installer.jar --installServer`: Run the Forge installer, creates a second file called **forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar**.
6. `java -Xms1024M -Xmx2000M -jar /opt/minecraft/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar nogui`: Start the minecraft server with a minimum 1gb of memory with a maximum of 2gb allocated, also run the server in nogui for faster performace.

8. *Optional:* `nano` to the `server.properties` file then set the `level-seed` to a preset seed if that is desired.
9. Create a script to start the minecraft server if that is desired to make launching easier, I did it. It should be a `.sh` file with the following contents. After creating it make sure to use `chmod` to make it executable, this was the initial script:
```bash
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#!/bin/bash
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd /opt/minecraft/ && java -Xms1024M -Xmx2000M -jar /opt/minecraft/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar nogui

To do this navigate to the SSH server config file at /etc/ssh/sshd_config, then make the following changes to the file.

conf
Port 2222
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin no
After this restart the SSH service with sudo systemctl restart and generate a ssh key pair with the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com" I then transferred the key to my other local machine. Test connection status with the command ssh -p 2222 youruser@your-server-ip.

### Network Security

I first setup port forwarding on my router to allow users to access my internal server from my public IP on port 25565. Reference your routers documentation to complete this.
I then blocked all other non-necessary ports on the server itself with the command:
sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp.
To only allow SSH locally only ensure ufw is enabled then use the command: sudo ufw allow from <local_subnet> to any port 2222 proto tcp. In my case the local subnet was 192.168....

### Backups

I regularly backed up the server files to a safe location (another computer) to avoid getting bashed by my friends for losing all their progress. This backup can be used to restore the entire world itself.

Bash
login to your server
cd /opt
tar -zcvf minecraft_backup.tar.gz minecraft
#### Automatic

To make the backups automatic on a weekly basis create the following script:

Bash
# What to backup.  Name of minecraft folder in /opt
backup_files="minecraft"

# Specify which directory to backup to.
# Warning: minecraft worlds can get fairly large so choose your backup destination accordingly.
dest="/home/username/minecraftbackups"

# Create backup archive filename.
day=$(date +%A)
archive_file="$day-$backup_files-.tar.gz"

## Summary of Experience

Constructing this Minecraft server turned a simple evening of gaming with friends into a rewarding dive into system administration. Though built on humble hardware, the foundational skills I gained from Linux fundamentals and security measures to efficient server management readily scale to enterprise-level challenges. It's a reminder that the most enduring knowledge emerges from hands on projects that combine enjoyment with expertise. is there anything technically wrong with this article not spelling or grammar

Technical Inaccuracies in the Article
I've reviewed the article for technical errors, focusing solely on factual, procedural, or conceptual inaccuracies in the Linux/Minecraft/server setup processes. I ignored spelling, grammar, phrasing, and style issues (e.g., "xms, xms" instead of "Xms, Xmx"). The content is mostly solid for a beginner-friendly guide, but there are 8 notable technical issues across sections. These range from minor syntax errors in commands to conceptual mismatches that could lead to failures or security risks if followed verbatim.

I've grouped them by section, with a table for quick reference, including the original description, the issue, and a suggested fix. Issues are prioritized by severity (high: could break setup or cause lockout; medium: inefficient/risky; low: imprecise but workable).

Summary of Issues by Section
Section	# of Issues	Severity Breakdown
Step 2: Linux Hygiene	3	2 low, 1 medium
Step 4: Security (SSH/Network)	2	1 high, 1 medium
Backups	1	Medium
Server Improvements	1	Medium
Other (General)	1	Low
Detailed Breakdown
Step 2: Linux Hygiene
Issue 1 (Low - Command Syntax): In item 2, apt install curl/wget uses a slash, which APT interprets as a package name literal ("curl/wget"), causing a failure ("Package 'curl/wget' has no installation candidate").
Fix: Change to apt install curl wget (space-separated packages).
Issue 2 (Low - Command Shorthand): In item 4, /opt, mkdir minecraft, cd minecraft is presented as a single command line, but it's a comma-separated list of actions. Running it verbatim fails (bash sees it as one invalid command).
Fix: Clarify as separate commands: cd /opt && mkdir minecraft && cd minecraft.
Issue 3 (Medium - Resource Allocation Mismatch): In item 6, the command allocates -Xms1024M -Xmx2000M (1-2GB), which is fine for 8GB RAM. However, the later "Server Improvements" section jumps to -Xms2G -Xmx6G without noting the hardware limit—6GB max on 8GB total leaves ~2GB for the OS, risking OOM kills or instability during peaks.
Fix: Add a note: "Scale based on RAM; with 8GB total, cap at -Xmx4G to leave headroom for Ubuntu."
Step 4: Security
Issue 1 (High - Incomplete Service Restart): In SSH Security, sudo systemctl restart lacks the service name, so it fails ("Failed to restart <empty>.service"). This could lock users out mid-setup if connected via SSH on port 22.
Fix: Specify sudo systemctl restart ssh (or sshd on some distros).
Issue 2 (Medium - Firewall Semantics): In Network Security, sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp is described as "blocked all other non-necessary ports." This only allows 25565; it doesn't inherently block others unless UFW's default policy is deny incoming (which it is post-enable). However, if UFW was previously configured with other allows (e.g., SSH on 22), this leaves gaps. The phrasing implies a full lockdown, misleading readers.
Fix: Add sudo ufw default deny incoming before the allow, and verify with ufw status verbose.
Backups
Issue 1 (Medium - Cron Schedule Mismatch): The cron line 02 2 * * * /opt/scripts/mcbackup.sh &> /dev/null runs daily at 2:02 AM (the five fields: min=02, hour=2, day-of-month=, month=, day-of-week=*). But the text says "automatic on a weekly basis," creating a discrepancy that could fill storage unexpectedly.
Fix: For weekly (e.g., Sundays), change to 02 2 * * 0 (last field=0 for Sunday). Add a note on storage impact.
Server Improvements
Issue 1 (Medium - Unnecessary/ Risky Sudo): The restart loop uses sudo java ..., but Java/Minecraft doesn't require root privileges—running as root risks file permission issues (e.g., world files owned by root) or exploits if mods are untrusted. It also echoes unnecessary prompts.
Fix: Remove sudo; run as the minecraft user (e.g., su - minecraft -c "java ..." or chown the dir). Add logging: echo "$(date): Starting..." >> /var/log/minecraft.log.
Other/General
Issue 1 (Low - SSH Config Simplification): The SSH config omits ChallengeResponseAuthentication no and KbdInteractiveAuthentication no, which are needed to fully disable password prompts (especially with PAM). Pubkey works, but fallback methods might still prompt. PermitRootLogin=no is good, but if root is needed, it blocks key auth too.
Fix: Add the missing lines for completeness, or note: "Test thoroughly to ensure no password fallback."
Overall Assessment
Strengths: Steps are logical and cover real-world basics (e.g., Forge install, screen, whitelisting). Hardware choice fits low-spec modded MC. Security basics (non-std port, keys, local SSH) are sound.
No Critical Gaps: Nothing prevents basic functionality, but the high-severity item (incomplete restart) could cause lockouts.
Recommendations: Test the full guide on a VM to verify. For 1.12.2 Forge (ancient), warn about mod compatibility/security (e.g., no modern exploits patched). If scaling, mention monitoring tools like htop.
If you provide more context (e.g., distro version), I can refine further!

what about grammar? not technical

Grammar Issues in the Article
I've scanned the article for grammar-specific problems, focusing on sentence structure, punctuation, agreement, tense consistency, parallelism, and clarity (e.g., fragments, run-ons, awkward phrasing). I excluded spelling, technical accuracy, and style preferences (e.g., informal tone like "peashooter"). Overall, the writing is clear and engaging, but there are 15 grammar issues—mostly minor fragments, missing commas, or inconsistent tense. These won't derail readers but could polish the professional feel.

Issues are grouped by section in the table below. For each, I include the original text, the problem, and a suggested fix. Severity: High (affects readability), Medium (awkward but understandable), Low (nitpicky).

Objective, last para	"This article assumes you have sudo access... & Linux"	Inconsistent capitalization in list; ampersand (&) is informal for formal lists.	"This article assumes you have sudo access on the server and are knowledgeable with Minecraft and Linux." (Remove italics if not needed; use "and" for parallelism.)	Low
Hardware
Location	Original	Issue	Suggested Fix	Severity
Hardware intro para	"Thankfully I had a spare Dell OptiPlex 7010 tower lying around, this was perfect..."	Run-on: Two independent clauses joined by comma without conjunction.	"Thankfully, I had a spare Dell OptiPlex 7010 tower lying around; this was perfect..." (Or use period.)	High
Self-host benefits list	"* Max control

Step 2: Linux Hygiene
Location	Original	Issue	Suggested Fix	Severity
Intro sentence	"The next step was to have Linux properly setup prior to adding everything..."	Dangling modifier: "setup" should be "set up" (verb); passive voice is vague.	"The next step was to properly set up Linux before adding everything..."	Medium

SSH Security, 2nd bullet	"...and remove possible worries of using a password and having it be leaked."	Parallelism: "provide stronger... and remove..." mixes infinitive and gerund.	"...and to remove worries about using a password that could be leaked."	Medium
Network Security, 3rd bullet	"* To only allow SSH locally only ensure ufw is enabled..."	Redundancy/fragment: "locally only" repeats; starts with infinitive as imperative.	"* To allow SSH only from the local network, ensure UFW is enabled, then..."	Medium
Backups
Location	Original	Issue	Suggested Fix	Severity
Intro para	"...to avoid getting bashed by my friends for losing all their progress."	Informal dangling: "getting bashed" is slang; could be clearer.	"...to avoid backlash from my friends if I lost all their progress."	Medium
Overall Assessment
Common Patterns: Run-ons from comma splices (fix with semicolons or periods) and parallelism in lists/bullets (keep structures consistent).
Tense Consistency: Mostly past tense for narrative, but slips into present in instructions—fine for guides, but unify if possible.
No Major Overhauls Needed: The article reads smoothly; these tweaks would make it tighter.

title: Configuring a Bare-Metal Linux Server to Play with Friends image: INSERTIMAGE. date: 2025-10-13 12:00:00 categories: [linux, sysadmin] tags: [linux,sysadmin]
Objective
After diving into different subjects in the realm of computers, networking, system administration, and security, you get exposed to a lot all at once. To retain the information effectively without staying to study all day, it seems the best way to learn is to split your time between studying and building. Furthermore, it is even better if you can build something you yourself can use—but if other people in your life can use it too, it's even better.

Hence, my latest addition to my portfolio of projects is configuring a modded Minecraft server for me and my friends to play on. This covers everything from adjusting the BIOS of a Dell tower, installing Ubuntu, hardening the Linux OS and the network to only allow users what they need. To sum it up, it's IT, sys administration, and security all in one!

This article assumes you have sudo access on the server and are knowledgeable with Minecraft and Linux.

Hardware
Thankfully, I had a spare Dell OptiPlex 7010 tower lying around; this was perfect as it was not too beefy but also not a peashooter. For reference, it was new when Windows 7 came out. I wanted to self-host this server as it provided:

Maximum control
The ability to work with the CLI
It's cheaper than a VPS
Learning the full process of hosting from start to finish
Server Specifications
320 GB SATA
Intel Core i7-3770S
8 GB RAM (DDR3)
Step 1: Changing the OS
I wanted the maximum amount of resources available for the Minecraft server since I was on limited hardware, so I chose Ubuntu. I chose Ubuntu because Windows inherently has more 'bloat' that can eat away at the total amount of compute power for other processes that matter more.

So, I chose my favorite USB stick, then used Rufus to format it and put the latest Ubuntu ISO file on it. I then put it into the OptiPlex while it was off, turned it on, spammed F12 to get it into the BIOS, and set the boot order to be the USB first.

I then installed Ubuntu and followed the prompts without changing anything out of the ordinary.

Step 2: Linux Hygiene
The next step was to properly set up Linux before adding everything for Minecraft; this included using the following commands while directly connected to the Linux box. The commands assume you have sudo access; security setup will be in the next section.

apt update && apt upgrade: Update & upgrades
apt install curl wget: Install necessary packages
apt install screen: Used to have the server run properly when not logged onto the server.
cd /opt && mkdir minecraft && cd minecraft: Navigate to the /opt directory, then create a folder called minecraft, then navigate to it. Once in the minecraft directory, download the Forge installer for 1.12.2 and then copy it to this dir. This version of Forge is included as it is not extremely old but has the most compatibility with everyone's favorite mods. Note: If using SSH for initial configuration, use something like WinSCP or SCP to transfer the files to your Linux server.
java -jar forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860-installer.jar --installServer: Run the Forge installer; it creates a second file called forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar.
java -Xms1024M -Xmx2000M -jar /opt/minecraft/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar nogui: Start the Minecraft server with a minimum of 1 GB of memory and a maximum of 2 GB allocated; also run the server in nogui for faster performance. Knowing how Xms, Xmx, and JVM work in conjunction with managing JVM's heaps is useful here.
Accept the EULA by navigating to the eula.txt file with nano, then set eula=true.
Optional:nano to the server.properties file, then set the level-seed to a preset seed if that is desired.
Create a script to start the Minecraft server if desired to make launching easier—I did. It should be a .sh file with the following contents. After creating it, make sure to use chmod to make it executable; this was the initial script:
Bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /opt/minecraft/ && java -Xms1024M -Xmx2000M -jar /opt/minecraft/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar nogui
Before starting the server, use the screen command followed by Ctrl + A, then C to start a screen session. Then start the server with the script; after that is complete, use the shortcut Ctrl + A, then D to detach from the session, allowing you to do other configuration while the server is running. To reattach to the screen session whenever you need, use the screen -r command; learn more on the screen command here.
At this point, users on your local network can connect to the server and play on it as long as they are also running Minecraft + Forge 1.12.2. However, there are no mods currently, and we need to make the server available over the internet (securely) still.

Step 3. Mods
Download your mods from one of the reputable mod library sites that are supported with Forge; I used CurseForge. Users on the client side will put their mods in this folder: C:\Users\YOURUSERHERE\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods

Step 4. Security
Now that the server is running with everything installed on the Minecraft side, it is time to harden the server. Each section below will go over the specific security addition.

SSH Security
The following section applies changes to SSH configuration, choosing a non-standard port and only allowing key-based authentication.

I chose a non-standard SSH port other than the default of 22 to avoid low-hanging-fruit-style attacks, where the port will be scanned either manually or automatically to identify potential system vulnerabilities.
Key-based authentication was used to provide stronger authentication and to remove worries about using a password that could be leaked.
To do this, navigate to the SSH server config file at /etc/ssh/sshd_config, then make the following changes to the file.

conf
Port 2222
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin no
After this, restart the SSH service with sudo systemctl restart ssh and generate an SSH key pair with the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com". I then transferred the key to my other local machine. Test connection status with the command ssh -p 2222 youruser@your-server-ip.

Network Security
I first set up port forwarding on my router to allow users to access my internal server from my public IP on port 25565. Reference your router's documentation to complete this.
I then blocked all other non-necessary ports on the server itself with the following commands:
Bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp
sudo ufw enable
To allow SSH only from the local network, ensure UFW is enabled, then use the command: sudo ufw allow from <local_subnet> to any port 2222 proto tcp. In my case, the local subnet was 192.168....
Whitelisting
Since my server was visible on port 25565, I then used whitelisting to only allow certain players to be able to join. To do this, first set white-list=true in the server.properties file. Then restart the server, then use the command whitelist add USERNAME for each player you want to be able to join.

Backups
I regularly backed up the server files to a safe location (another computer) to avoid backlash from my friends if I lost all their progress. This backup can be used to restore the entire world itself.

Bash
# Log in to your server
cd /opt
tar -zcvf minecraft_backup.tar.gz minecraft
Automatic
To make the backups automatic on a weekly basis, create the following script:

Bash
# What to backup. Name of minecraft folder in /opt
backup_files="minecraft"

# Specify which directory to backup to.
# Warning: Minecraft worlds can get fairly large, so choose your backup destination accordingly.
dest="/home/username/minecraftbackups"

# Create backup archive filename.
day=$(date +%A)
archive_file="$day-$backup_files-.tar.gz"

# Backup the files using tar.
cd /opt && tar zcvf $dest/$archive_file $backup_files
Make sure to make the file executable with chmod and test the script before creating a scheduled task. Then create a task with the cron scheduler; use this line at the end of a root crontab: 02 2 * * 0 /opt/scripts/mcbackup.sh &> /dev/null (runs weekly on Sundays).

Server Improvements
I recreated my script to have a catch for when it inevitably crashed at some point, whether it was from a player overusing resources or generic crashes.
Bash
while true; do 
	echo "Starting Minecraft server..." 
	java -Xms2G -Xmx4G -jar /opt/minecraft/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar nogui  # Scaled for 8GB RAM; adjust as needed
	echo "Minecraft server crashed or stopped. Restarting in 10 seconds..." 
	sleep 10 
done
Summary of Experience
Constructing this Minecraft server turned a simple evening of gaming with friends into a rewarding dive into system administration. Though built on humble hardware, the foundational skills I gained—from Linux fundamentals and robust security measures to efficient server management—readily scale to enterprise-level challenges. It's a reminder that the most enduring knowledge emerges from hands-on projects that marry enjoyment with expertise.

Cleaning up orphan processes why does this fail '

The error in your GitHub Actions workflow for deploying to GitHub Pages stems primarily from the actions/deploy-pages@v2 step failing to retrieve the signed artifact URL. This triggers an HTTP 404 error because it cannot locate the workflow run using the provided github.run_id (19844268501 in this case). Here's a breakdown of why this happens and how to fix it:

Root Causes
Outdated Action Version (v2): You're using actions/deploy-pages@v2, which is deprecated and has known bugs related to artifact resolution and run ID lookup. This version struggles with fetching metadata from the same workflow run, especially if the build/upload step is recent or encounters transient GitHub API issues. Newer versions (v3/v4) handle this more reliably.
Missing or Invalid Artifact: The deploy step expects an artifact named github-pages (uploaded via actions/upload-pages-artifact) from the same workflow run. If the preceding build job failed, was skipped, ran concurrently, or didn't upload the artifact correctly, the deploy job can't access it—leading to the "Cannot find any run" error. The stack trace points to getSignedArtifactMetadata failing here.
GitHub Pages Configuration Mismatch: Although your site is live and Pages is enabled, the error's suggestion ("Ensure GitHub Pages has been enabled") is a generic fallback. The real issue may be that Pages is configured to deploy from a branch (e.g., main or gh-pages) rather than GitHub Actions. If set to branch deployment, Actions-based deploys will 404.
Other Potential Factors:
Permissions: The GITHUB_TOKEN needs pages:write scope (default for public repos), but if this is a fork/PR or custom token, it might lack it.
Run Timing/Concurrency: If jobs aren't sequential (needs: build-job), the deploy might run before the artifact exists.
Transient GitHub Issues: Rare, but API hiccups (check githubstatus.com) can cause run ID lookups to fail.
Your specific build version (dd530ab69861627ffd1929d7f06d4aca34291c89) is a valid commit ("more changes" from Dec 2, 2025), so the push triggered the workflow correctly—the failure is downstream in deployment.

Fixes
Update to the Latest Action Versions:
Change actions/deploy-pages@v2 to @v4 (current latest as of Dec 2025).
Ensure the upload step uses actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4 (v3 is deprecated since Jan 2025).
Example workflow snippet (in .github/workflows/deploy.yml or similar):
YAML

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4  # Updated!
Configure GitHub Pages Source:
Go to https://github.com/rkuczer/rkuczer.github.io/settings/pages.
Under "Build and deployment", select Source: GitHub Actions.
Save. This enables Actions-based deploys (your current setup might be branch-based, causing conflicts).
Verify Workflow Structure:
Ensure deploy job has needs: build to run sequentially.
Check Actions tabgithub.com for the full run log of ID 19844268501—look for failures in the build/upload step.
Rerun the workflow after fixes (via push or manual re-run).
Test and Debug:
Add debug logging: Set ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true in repo secrets.
If using a custom runner, switch to ubuntu-latest (GitHub-hosted).
Monitor for deprecations: Artifact actions v3 are fully unsupported post-Jan 2025—v4 is mandatory now.
After these changes, push a test commit to trigger a fresh run. If it still fails, share your full .github/workflows/*.yml file for deeper troubleshooting. Your setup (Chirpy/Jekyll on modest hardware) should deploy smoothly once resolved!

Why This Fixes the Failure
Your original YAML is solid overall (good use of configure-pages, Ruby/Jekyll setup for Chirpy, and htmlproofer testing), but the deprecation of actions/deploy-pages@v2 and actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 is the culprit. As of January 2025, GitHub enforces v4 for these actions due to API changes in artifact handling and run metadata lookup—v2/v3 often fail with 404s on getSignedArtifactMetadata because they can't resolve the current workflow's run_id reliably (e.g., your error: "Cannot find any run with github.run_id 19844268501").

Key Changes:

Upgrade to v4: deploy-pages@v4 and upload-pages-artifact@v4 resolve the artifact exchange and signed URL issues. These versions use updated GitHub APIs for better concurrency and OIDC auth.
Configure Pages to v5: Minor bump for latest features (e.g., improved base_path handling); v3 still works but aligns with ecosystem.
No Other Edits Needed: Permissions, concurrency, and job dependencies (needs: build) are correct. The paths-ignore avoids unnecessary runs on docs changes.
Next Steps
Replace the YAML: Overwrite .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml (e.g., deploy.yml) with this version and commit/push to main.
Verify Pages Config: In repo settings > Pages, ensure Source: GitHub Actions (not branch). If it's branch-based, switch to Actions.
Test the Run:
Push a small change (e.g., edit README) to trigger.
Watch the Actions tab: Build should upload artifact successfully; deploy should create a deployment without 404s.
If it fails, check logs for "artifact not found"—ensure _site builds cleanly (run locally: bundle exec jekyll build).
Debug Tips:
Enable debug: Add env: ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true to the deploy job.
For Chirpy-specific issues (e.g., assets submodule), uncomment submodules: true in checkout if needed.
If still stuck, share the new run ID/logs from Actions tab.
This should deploy your site (e.g., to https://rkuczer.github.io) flawlessly—Chirpy themes love this setup! If you hit snags, drop the error logs.
